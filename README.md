# Clustering_Classification_Project

## Clustering Analysis  
Performed **customer segmentation** to identify different spending behaviors:  
- **Cluster 0**: High balance, moderate spending, low transaction frequency.  
  - ðŸ“Œ Strategy: Offer loyalty programs to increase purchases.  
- **Cluster 1**: Low balance, frequent small purchases, low credit limit.  
  - ðŸ“Œ Strategy: Provide credit limit increases or purchase incentives.  
- **Cluster 2**: Premium users with high spending and frequent transactions.  
  - ðŸ“Œ Strategy: Retain with exclusive rewards and cashback offers.  

## Classification Analysis  
Evaluated and fine-tuned a **Random Forest model** for customer classification:  
- Accuracy: **Before tuning - 99%**, After tuning - **98%**.  
- **Improvement:** Better handling of minority class (higher recall).  
- **Next Steps:**  
  - Increase data for minority class.  
  - Use **SMOTE** or class weighting for better balance.  
  - Explore **XGBoost** or **Gradient Boosting** for potential improvements.  

## Conclusion  
The project provides **actionable insights** for improving customer engagement and optimizing classification models for better decision-making.
